For example, in temperature, yin is cold\\nand yang is hot. In gender, yin is female and yang is\\nmale. In activity, yin is passive and yang is active.

Another fundamental concept of Chinese\\nmedicine is that of chi (pronouncedchee, also spelled\\nqi).

In the body, it is the\\ninvisible vital force that creates and animates life.\\nWe are all born with inherited amounts of chi, and\\nwe also get acquired chi from the food we eat and the\\nair we breathe.

The\\nadrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine gland\\nwith two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. The\\nmain hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and the\\nmain hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine.\\nWhen tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they\\nsecrete excess amounts of these hormones.

The result is the type of breath-\\ning distress called ARDS. ARDS is one of the major\\ncauses of excess fluid in the lungs, the other beingheart\\nfailure.\\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\\ninflamed cells in the lungs.

It is a diagnosis of exclusion,\\nmeaning that when a decrease in vision is detected,\\nother causes must be ruled out. Once no other cause is\\nfound, amblyopia is the diagnosis. Generally, a differ-\\nence of two lines or more (on an eye-chart test of visual\\nacuity) between the two eyes or a best corrected vision\\nof 20/30 or worse would be defined as amblyopia.

Amblyopia\\nis the most common cause of impaired vision in child-\\nren, affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or\\n2-4% of the population. Vision is a combination of the\\nclarity of the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the\\nprocessing of those images by the brain. If the images\\nproduced by the two eyes are substantially different,\\nthe brain may not be able to fuse the images. Instead of\\nseeing two different images or double vision (diplo-\\npia), the brain suppresses the blurrier image. This\\nsuppression can lead to amblyopia. During the first\\nfew years of life, preferring one eye over the other may\\nlead to poor visual development in the blurrier eye.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome of the major causes of amblyopia are as\\nfollows:\\n/C15Strabismus.

It is major surgery performed in a hospital\\nunder general anesthesiaand involves removing debris\\nand then implanting a flexibletube (graft) to replace the\\nenlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of\\nthe ascending aorta (the firstpart of the aorta that travels\\nupward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lung\\nmachine that temporarily stops the heart while the\\naneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a\\none-week hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks.\\nDuring surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either\\nthe abdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to\\nexpose the aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and\\nbelow the aneurysm to stop the flow of blood. Then,\\nKEY TERMS\\nAneurysm— A weakening in the muscular walls of'),\n",
